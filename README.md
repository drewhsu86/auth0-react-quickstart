# Autho0 Test using React Quickstart Guide 

This short React app was created with the intention of learning and testing the Auth0 login system which can be found here [on Auth0's site](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react). Please see this guide on how to set up an Auth0 account, configure the necessary information on Auth0's dashboard, and then importing Auth0 using npm and using it to write components that give login, logout and login status functionality.
